# Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them

# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

# Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line
print("Hello, World!") # This is a comment

# A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code
# print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")

# Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
# To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line

# This is a comment
# written in
# more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

# Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable,
# you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it
